nhanesGraph is a package that provides an accessible and interactive way for users to export NHANES data as well as view data trends via Shiny package. This package is an extension of the [RNHANES](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNHANES/vignettes/introduction.html) package created by Herb Susmann. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of nhanesGraph from [GitHub](https://github.com/minjee-kim/nhanesGraph) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("minjee-kim/nhanesGraph")
```

## Example

Users are able to search the NHANES file of interest via nGraph_search() Shiny app. 



For a console command, users can access the data by specifying the year, file name, and whether they want to include demographic information in their data. 


```{r example}
library(nhanesGraph)

head(nhanes_table("2007-2008", "EPH"))

```

There will be a plot that looks much nicer than this :)
